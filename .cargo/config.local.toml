# NOTE: This file overrides config.toml settings
# It's used to run tests with host target instead of embedded target
#
# To use this:
# 1. When you want to run tests: rename config.toml -> config.toml.embedded && rename config.local.toml -> config.toml
# 2. When you want to build embedded binary: rename config.toml -> config.local.toml && rename config.toml.embedded -> config.toml
#
# Or just use: make test  (for tests) or make build (for embedded binary)
